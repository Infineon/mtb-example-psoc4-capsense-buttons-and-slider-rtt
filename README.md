## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator â€“ Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries must be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command-line tool (*project-creator-cli*). The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command-line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[CAPSENSE&trade; Buttons and Slider RTT](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-buttons-and-slider-rtt)" application with the desired name "CapsenseButtonsandSliderRTT" configured for the [*CY8CKIT-149*](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-149) BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-149 --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-buttons-and-slider-rtt --user-app-name CapsenseButtonsandSliderRTT --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal by using the `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool (library-manager-cli) to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be the active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from the manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP to a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the [CY8CKIT-149](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-149) BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/CapsenseButtonsandSliderRTT" --add-bsp-name CY8CKIT-149 --add-bsp-version "latest-v3.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/CapsenseButtonsandSliderRTT" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CKIT-149
   ```

      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-149TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically.

### Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner

1. Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner from the 'BSP Configurators' section in the IDE **Quick Panel**.
2. Ensure that the kits are in CMSIS-DAP Bulk mode (KitProg3 Status LED is ON and not blinking). See [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3.
3. In the tuner application, click on the **Tuner communication setup** icon or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window that appears, select the RTT checkbox under KitProg3 and configure it as shown in **Figure 1**.

7. The Tuner GUI displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View** and **Graph View** tabs.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense) (see ModusToolbox&trade; user guide for more details on selecting the middleware). See [AN85951 â€“ PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

The code example implements CAPSENSE&trade; buttons and slider example for PSoC&trade; 4 devices using RTT to connect to CAPSENSE&trade; tuner. This is an alternative to the existing I2C and UART channels, and communication happens over SWD lines to connect to the tuner.

The design contains multiple button widgets and a CAPSENSE&trade; slider and the RTT peripheral. The RTT peripheral is used to monitor the sensor data of buttons, slider, and slider touch position information on a PC using the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner available in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; via RTT communication.  

The code scans the widgets using the CSD sensing method and sends the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data over an RTT interface to the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner GUI tool on a PC.

### Resources and settings

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool.
   
   The CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool can be launched in Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; from the 'CSD peripheral' setting in the device configurator or in stand-alone mode directly from the Project Explorer.

   See the [ModusToolbox&trade; CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) for step-by-step instructions on how to configure and launch CAPSENSE&trade; in the ModusToolbox&trade;. 

3. In the **Basic** tab, a single slider **LinearSlider0** and multiple buttons (**Button0**, **Button1** and **Button2**) are configured as a **CSD**, and the CSD tuning mode is configured as **SmartSense (Full Auto-Tune)**. 

    **Figure 4. CAPSENSE&trade; configurator - Basic tab**
